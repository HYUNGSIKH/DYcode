Each Fortran files are different format.
tau0_gen.for = free-form Fortran
tide_fac.for = fixed-form Fortran
Thus, 
tau0_gen.for = free-form Fortran was run in the cmd Windows
tide_fac.for = fixed-form Fortran was run in the NOTEPAD++.

Since it can be confusing, I created and upload the file ".EXE".
